## Description
Employee-Tracker is a robust command-line application designed to streamline the management of a company's employee database. Built from the ground up, this application leverages the power of Node.js to provide a fast, efficient, and user-friendly interface.

At the heart of Employee-Tracker is Inquirer, a comprehensive collection of common interactive command-line user interfaces. Inquirer is used to generate a series of prompts, allowing users to easily navigate through the application and perform a variety of tasks such as adding, viewing, and updating employee records.

The application is backed by PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. PostgreSQL provides advanced features such as MVCC (multi-version concurrency control), point-in-time recovery, tablespaces, and more. This ensures that Employee-Tracker can handle complex queries and large databases with ease.
